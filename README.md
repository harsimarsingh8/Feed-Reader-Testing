# Feed-Reader-Testing

> Harsimar Singh


-----------------------------------------------------------

* Learning about testing with Javascript.
* In this project, we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We were provided with [Jasmine Github respository](http://jasmine.github.io/) with an application with an incomplete test suite. We have to complete those suites.
* New test suites were built according to specifications provided and initial resources were tested using Jasmine.
* The live streaming of [project](https://harsimarsingh8.github.io/Feed-Reader-Testing/index.html).
* Project can be viewed at my [Github Repository](https://github.com/harsimarsingh8/Feed-Reader-Testing).

# About Project

RSS (Rich Site Summary; originally RDF Site Summary; often called Really Simple Syndication) uses a family of standard web feed formats to publish frequently updated information: blog entries, news headlines, audio, video. ... RSS feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically.


Simply, the role of the Feedreader is to gather and display web feeds (data format used for serving users frequently updated infrormation) from various websites in one place. By using feedreader you can have updates from several websites delivered to you, without need to visit each of them indivisually.

- This project helps to test the given project with the help of JavaScript

-  This is very useful for making a beautiful tested website.
